# GNU-Toolchain-and-RISC-V-ISA
NTUST 109-2 Computer Organization

RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced
instruction set computer (RISC) principles since 2010. RISC-V supports three word-widths, 32,
64, and 128 bits, and a variety of subsets. In this project, you will learn the high-level language
translation flow and study the relations between high-level C/C++ code and RISC-V assembly.
You are required to write a simple Makefile to build your own executable program, library,
compiled objects, and RISC-V assembly codes from a C/C++ project with multiple source files.
For consistency, we use two GNU RISC-V 32-bit toolchains (riscv32-unknown-elf-* and
riscv32-unknown-linux-gnu-*) in this project.
